# Grade-Air-Case-Backend
Grade Air transports over 30 millon passengers each year to many destinations worldwide. it's becoming summer again and a lot of people want to go on vacation. Grade Air sells plane tickets on their own website. At this moment they are using a REST API to process all data. so I created version 2 of the API using Nest.js(Node.js), GraphQl, and TypeScript.
